Fishing Game for M5StickC Plus 2

An immersive fishing simulation game designed for the M5StickC Plus 2, featuring realistic physics, diverse fish species, weather effects, and engaging gameplay mechanics.

Core Gameplay

Motion-Controlled Fishing: Tilt the device to aim your fishing rod and swing to cast
Realistic Fishing Mechanics: Hold Button B to extend your line, release to set the hook
12 Unique Fish Species: Each with different behaviors, point values, and catch difficulties
Dynamic Weather System: Clear, rainy, and stormy conditions that affect gameplay
Combo System: Chain catches for bonus points and multipliers

Advanced Features

Power-Up System: Temporary boosts including Big Hook, Time Slow, and Double Points
Particle Effects: Splash effects, bubbles, and visual feedback for enhanced immersion
Adaptive Difficulty: Game becomes more challenging as you progress
High Score Tracking: Compete against your personal best
Sound & Vibration: Audio-visual feedback for all game events


Controls

Button Layout

Button M5: Start game / Menu navigation / Restart
Button A:

Hold to extend fishing line
Tap rapidly when fish is hooked
Toggle settings in menu



Motion Controls

Tilt Left/Right: Aim fishing rod (±30° range)
Swing Motion: Cast your line (uses accelerometer and gyroscope)
IMU Sensitivity: Responds to acceleration changes > 2.0G or movement > 0.8G

Weather System
The game features a dynamic weather system that changes every 30 seconds:

Clear Weather: Normal fishing conditions
Rainy Weather: Animated raindrops, slightly affects fish behavior
Stormy Weather: Turbulent conditions, fish move more erratically

Detailed State Descriptions

Menu: Game introduction and settings
Waiting to Cast: Aim your rod and swing to start
Fishing: Control line depth, avoid going too deep
Fish Hooked: Rapidly tap Button B to reel in the fish
Caught/Missed: Success celebration or missed opportunity
Game Over: Final score and restart option

Scoring System

Normal Fish: 10-20 points
Fast Fish: 25-30 points
Rare Fish: 50 points
Golden Fish: 100 points

Bonus Multipliers

Combo Bonus: +5 points per consecutive catch
Power-Up Bonus: 2x points when Double Points is active
Difficulty Bonus: Additional points based on game progression

Power-Up System
Power-ups spawn randomly during gameplay and last for 10 seconds:

Big Hook: Increases hook collision radius for easier catches
Time Slow: Reduces line extension speed for better control
Double Points: Doubles all point values temporarily

🛠️ Technical Requirements
Hardware

M5StickC Plus 2 device
Built-in IMU (accelerometer/gyroscope)
135x240 color LCD display
Two programmable buttons (A & B)

Software Dependencies
cpp#include <M5StickCPlus2.h>
Memory Usage

Fish Array: 12 fish objects with position, velocity, and state data
Particle System: 20 particle objects for visual effects
Weather System: Rain drop array and weather state tracking
Display Optimization: Reduced refresh rates to minimize screen flashing

Installation & Setup

Install Arduino IDE with M5StickC Plus 2 board support
Download the Code: Copy Fishing_game_v2.ino to your Arduino projects folder
Connect Device: Use USB-C cable to connect M5StickC Plus 2
Upload: Select correct board and port, then upload the sketch
Play: Device will boot directly into the game menu

Required Libraries

M5StickCPlus2 library (install via Arduino Library Manager)

Display Optimization
The game implements several optimization techniques:

Selective Rendering: Only redraws changed screen areas
Frame Rate Control: 50ms full updates, 20ms partial updates
Motion Detection: Tracks fish and hook movement to minimize unnecessary redraws
Status Caching: Reduces text rendering when status hasn't changed

Screen flickering

Normal during intense particle effects
Reduce particle count if performance issues occur

Fish not appearing

Check if fish array initialization completed
Restart game from menu if fish spawn incorrectly


Future Enhancements

Potential additions for future versions:

Multiplayer Mode: Compete with other M5StickC devices
Achievement System: Unlock rewards for specific accomplishments
Customizable Bait: Different lures affect fish attraction
Day/Night Cycle: Time-based lighting and fish behavior changes
Save Game Progress: Persistent statistics and unlockables
